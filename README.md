Hi there 👋, I'm Eddi, and I'm currently working as a PhD student at the University of Zurich.

👨‍🔬 [Our group's research](http://luber-group.com) is focused on the implementation of methods in the framework of density functional theory. I primarily work with [CP2K](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k) and implemented [some types](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0041056) of [perturbation theory](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00006) in the code. 

🔭 I'm using and contributing to the [archivy](https://github.com/archivy/archivy) knowledge base repo

🌱 I like learning new stuff. I'm currently going through the `Ray Tracing in One Weekend` series and trying to implement a simple ray tracer in Rust.
